Data for HA, Gal4, NP, and LAC are from DMS experiments and files were generated from [Spielman Wilke 2016](https://github.com/sjspielman/mutsel_benchmark). These files were directly ported from that repo.

Data for `HIV_prefs.csv` is the `BG505_avgprefs.csv` from [https://elifesciences.org/articles/34420](https://elifesciences.org/articles/34420) SI

We therefore have 5 realistic parameterizations. Hot damn.
