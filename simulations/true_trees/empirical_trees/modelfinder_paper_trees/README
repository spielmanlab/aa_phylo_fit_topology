This file acts as a detailed step-by-step log of events that led to Table 1. The folder within which this file is found contains the following items:

Andersen_2015      (folder)
dos_Reis_2012      (folder)
Prum_2015          (folder)

STEP-BY-STEP LOG
01.  Initially, we set up a structure of folders within these five folders:
     01_Original_data (original information obtained from web site and/or the authors)
     02_Revised_data  (alignment of data in FASTA format)
     03_IQ-TREE_STd   (implementation of popular model selection)
     04_IQ-TREE_STa   (implementation of popular model selection, with tree search)
     05_IQ-TREE_MFd   (default ModelFinder)
     06_IQ_TREE_MFa   (advanced ModelFinder)
     07_IQ-TREE_x     (Tree-search, assuming best model inferred using popular method (x))
     08_IQ-TREE_y     (Tree-search, assuming best model inferred using ModelFinder (y))
     09_TreeDist      (comparison of trees)
This structure was used for analysis of each data set. Each of these folders contain the relevant data and script to analyse the data. 

02.  Then we ran Distributor.sh to distribute the (sometimes) very large input file to the right folders.

03.  Identification of optimal models (03_, 04_, 05_, and 06_) was repeated 10-100 times each to minimise the chance of entrapment in local optima. 

04.  Phylogenetic analyses under the optimal models of SE (07_ and 08_) were repeated 100 time each to minimise the chance of entrapment in local optima.

05.  The most likely tree in 07_IQ-TREE_x and the most likely tree in 08_IQ-TREE_y were copied to /09_TreeDist/intree. 

06.  Using IQ-TREE's -rf_all option, the Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance was calculated between the trees in /09_TreeDist/intree.

07.  The results from analyses of the five data sets were reported in Table 1.
